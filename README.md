Hi,

My name is Beatriz Aoyama and I am postdoc student at State University of Campinas, SP, Brasil. 

This GitHub page was created to share bioinformatics pipelines, specifically for the analysis of mammalian RNA-seq data using the most widely used alignment tools and statistical packages. 
This project is part of my postdoctoral research and aims to help other students in the biological sciences become interested in the field of bioinformatics.

These are my contacts in case of doubts or suggestions:
